# Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Social Resources
Developer: Stefania Frustagli

## Website Overview
The purpose of this website is to provide a centralized repository of resources from social media related to understanding narcissistic and violent behaviors. By incorporating reels from platforms, like Instagram and YouTube,  this project aims to shed light on subtle and recurrent abuse patterns. 
My goal is to raise awareness about these patterns, empowering individuals to recognize and protect themselves from toxic influences, ultimately leading to a better quality of life.
#### Why Narcissism awareness?
This is a very personal project. I wanted to share all the material I found helpful during the years. 
I strongly believe in the importance of education. Narcissistic abuse, or violent behaviours, can be insidious and difficult to identify, so it's crucial to have prevention and recovery plans. Through this project, I hope to facilitate discussions and provide valuable insights into narcissistic behaviors, helping individuals understand and navigate their experiences more effectively.

## Project's goal & background
### Problem Statement
Through the years, I have 'liked' on Instagram and YouTube a large amount of reels and videos about Narcissism. During my recovery journey, these reels and videos played an important role - actually, I would say they were pivotal in my recovery.
As we encounter a massive amount of information on social apps and may miss it, I wanted to make this material easily accessible, in one place, for those who might need it. 

How to do that? This website was my answer. 
The primary intent was to create a site, easy to navigate and interactive, containing all the material (or at least, at the beginning, some of it) that could be as helpful to others as it was for me.

### Agile Development
- The development process was carried out using Agile methodology with a focus on continuous improvement.

- The project was managed using a GitHub Project board with user stories and tasks.

- User Stories were differentiated in EPIC A, B, C, D, E and F according to users' type and content specificity. They were prioritised based on the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).

#### The design process: thinking through it
Originally, I planned to use a purple color palette since it felt neutral (the color also reminded me of vampires, and this creature would be perfectly associated with the theme).

However, as I was building the site and researching images, I wasn't sure about the color anymore. My interest was piqued by an illustration with a red background, a black silhouette of a body, and white strings. The colour red conveys danger vibes and it would fit perfectly - but it was too 'strong' so I reverted to purple.

Purple is neutral - it appears calm - yet mysterious and enigmatic, so in my mind it still evokes the alert feeling I want to reproduce. And as I said, it reminds me of vampires. The appropriate analogy with vampires and narcissism will be used at some point; I'm not sure how yet.

The colour purple is also associated with healing, and healing from narcissistic abuse is the ultimate hope for my users and the reason why I built this site.

### Future Features and general aspects left to implement
This is only the first version of a big project I have in mind. Find some of the future aspects left to implement below:

- **Graphics & content organisation**: 
In order to make the website professional and appealing, the graphic needs to be improved. I plan to hire an illustrator to design the topic images for the homepage or to do them myself.
In addition, I would like to improve the navigation with tags and organize the content more attractively.

- **Community page & comment app**:
You can see a comments app because I am planning to create a community page, an essential element of the website, as sharing is a fundamental step in the healing process.
To build the foundation for my future features, I decided to have an app to manage user interactions in my future community page.

- **Collaborations & courses**: 
My goal is to make the site more visible once aesthetics are improved. I'll share it on channels/platforms where the subject is discussed. My plan is to contact professionals who deal with the topic and arrange courses for users.

- **Error pages** are present in the website but the design  was left to implement.
