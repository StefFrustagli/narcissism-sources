## User Experience

### Project's goal & Design 
#### Original Colour palettes

### The thinking process
Originally, I planned to use a purple color palette since it felt neutral (the color also reminded me of vampires, and this creature would be perfectly associated with the theme).

However, as I was building the site and researching images, I wasn't sure about the color anymore. My interest was piqued by an illustration with a red background, a black silhouette of a body, and white strings. The colour red conveys danger vibes and it would fit perfectly - but it was too 'strong' so I reverted to purple.

Purple is neutral - it appears calm - yet mysterious and enigmatic, so in my mind it still evokes the alert feeling I want to reproduce. And as I said, it reminds me of vampires. The appropriate analogy with vampires and narcissism will be used at some point; I'm not sure how yet.
