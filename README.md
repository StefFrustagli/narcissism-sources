# Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Social Resources

Developer: Stefania Frustagli

## Website Overview

The purpose of this website is to provide a centralized repository of resources from social media related to understanding narcissistic and violent behaviors. By incorporating reels from platforms, like Instagram and YouTube, this project aims to shed light on subtle and recurrent abuse patterns.
My goal is to raise awareness about these patterns, empowering individuals to recognize and protect themselves from toxic influences, ultimately leading to a better quality of life.

#### Why Narcissism awareness?

This is a very personal project. I wanted to share all the material I found helpful during the years as a 'survivor'.
I strongly believe in the importance of education: narcissistic abuse, or violent behaviours in general, can be insidious and difficult to identify, so it's crucial to have prevention and recovery plans. Through this project, I hope to facilitate discussions and provide valuable insights into narcissistic behaviors, helping individuals understand and navigate their experiences more effectively.

## Project background 

### Agile Development

The development process for this project followed Agile methodology, emphasizing continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

**Project Management**: I utilised GitHub Project boards to manage tasks, user stories, and project progression effectively.

**User Stories**: User stories were categorized into EPICs A, B, C, D, E, and F based on user types and content specificity. I prioritized these user stories using the MoSCoW method, which categorizes requirements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have categories based on their importance and urgency.

**Continuous Improvement**: Despite working solo on this project, I actively sought ways to enhance development processes and product quality. Regular retrospectives allowed me to reflect on past work, pinpoint areas for improvement, and brainstorm solutions.

### Problem Statement
In the past few years, I have liked a large number of reels and videos about narcissism on Instagram and YouTube. These videos played a crucial role in my awareness journey - I believe they were pivotal to my recovery. But this material was somehow 'hidden' or lost in a sea of information on social apps, and I felt it was chaotic. I wanted to make this helpful material organised in one place and easily accessible to those who could benefit from it. It might have helped someone else as well.

**Proposed solution**: What can I do to accomplish that? My answer was this website. The primary intent was to create a site, easy to navigate and interactive, containing all the material (or at least some of it) that could be as helpful to others as much as it was tor me.

### The design process: thinking through it

Originally, I planned to use a purple color palette since it felt neutral (the color also reminded me of vampires, and this creature would be perfectly associated with the theme).

However, as I was building the site and researching images, I wasn't sure about the color anymore. My interest was piqued by an illustration with a red background, a black silhouette of a body, and white strings. The colour red conveys danger vibes and it would fit perfectly - but it was too 'strong' so I reverted to purple.

Purple is neutral - it appears calm - yet mysterious and enigmatic, so in my mind it still evokes the alert feeling I wanted to reproduce. And as I said, it reminds me of vampires. The appropriate analogy with vampires and narcissism will be used at some point; I'm not sure how yet.

The colour purple is also associated with healing, and healing from narcissistic abuse is the ultimate hope for my users and the reason why I built this site.

### Future Features and general aspects left to implement

I have a big project in mind, and this is just the first version. The following are some of the future aspects that still need to be implemented:

- **Graphics & content organisation**:
  In order to make the website professional and appealing, the graphic needs to be improved. I'm considering two approaches for enhancing the homepage: I may hire an illustrator to design topic images or, alternatively, creating these images myself.
  Additionally, I would like to improve the navigation with tags and organize the content more attractively.

- **User account**:
  One of the plans is to expand the functionalities available to users, aiming to streamline their experience. This would involve creating a dedicated user account page where users can manage their account settings and comments conveniently. Additionally, they will have options to delete their account and reset their password for added control over their personal information. 

- **Community page & comment app (or 'why did you create a Comments app?')**:
  I've included a comments app because I was laying the groundwork for a future community page. Even though its relevance may not be immediately apparent at the current state of the website, this is important in the future direction of the platform. Sharing is a crucial aspect of the healing process, and having a platform for users to interact will be integral to the site's purpose. The comments app will serve as an essential feature to manage user interactions and foster community engagement. This decision was made to establish a foundation for future features and enhance the overall user experience.

- **Collaborations & courses**:
  My primary objective is to better the site's visibility by focusing on aesthetic improvements. Once these enhancements are in place, I intend to promote the site on relevant channels and platforms where discussions related to the subject take place. My plan is to contact professionals to collaborate on content and offer courses tailored to users' interests and needs. 

- **Error pages** are present in the website but the design is left to implement.

### Code

The code was mainly based on Code Institute's walkthrough of the Django project. This is my first time using technologies such as Django and Bootstrap, so it has been challenging, but my goal is to make the code better going forward.
