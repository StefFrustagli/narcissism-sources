# Note: admin.ModelAdmin is the standard way of registering
#       our model with the admin panel. We do it differently
#       above because we are supplying Summernote fields.
#       If you want to customise the admin panel view in your
#       own projects, then inherit from admin.ModelAdmin like
#       we do below.
