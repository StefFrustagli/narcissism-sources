There was a problem embedding Instagram content within the application.  The Instagram posts were not displayed when using the short embed code (see below), but it only worked with the original embed code.
```
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/{{ content.source_identifier }}/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">
</blockquote>
```
The short embed code was preferred since tags and original captions would be removed.

To resolve this issue, an asynchronous script tag was added to the if statement in the resource_detail.html:
``` 
<script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>
```
The asynchronous script tag loads the Instagram embed JavaScript file from the Instagram domain.




## Remaining bugs

To the best of my knowledge, there are no remaining bugs.
